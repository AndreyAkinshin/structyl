# Structyl

Structyl is a build orchestration CLI for polyglot codebases. It provides a unified interface (`structyl build`, `structyl test`, `structyl clean`) across multiple programming languages while letting each use its native toolchain. Features include 27 built-in toolchains, shared JSON-based reference tests, version propagation, Docker integration, and dependency ordering.
